# Landing Page Project

## About the project
This brief project shows a landing page of a sample website. The aim of this project was to demonstrate the building of the navigation bar dynamically after the page has been loaded. All the code has been written in the `js/app.js` file with proper documentation. Some minor modifications have been made to the following files: 
- `index.html`
- `css/styles.css`

## Features
- Navigation bar built dynamically post page load.
- Active section shown with a **darker background** on the main page, 
- Active section shown with *italicised* text on the navbar.
- Navbar hides after user scrolls past below the fold and stops scrolling, otherwise stays visible.
- The site is completely responsive and usable on all devices.
